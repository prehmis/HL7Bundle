# HL7Bundle
HL7 bundle for Symfony 5

This code is still under development and is heavilly based on previous work by Aranya Sen.

The general idea of this bundle is to provide all tools required to enable an application to receive, process and send HL7 messages via HTTP(S). 

We have done so by implementing an incomming HL7 api and using Messenger to further direct and process the messeges.

More to follow soon.
